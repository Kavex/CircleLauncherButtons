This is my own custom version of Circle Launcher 2.11 made by Lybrica

I've added my buttons as well as all the current 2.11 buttons

I've also organized them into folders so you can find them easier than how it was before

Here is a guide to help you setup circle launcher ![Circle Launcher Newbie Guide](https://github.com/Kavex/CircleLauncherButtons/wiki/Circle-Launcher-Newbie-Guide)


Enjoy,
